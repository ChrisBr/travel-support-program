%h2 About the application

%p
  The goal of this web based application is to offer a convenient way of managing
  the requests and reimbursements from travel help programs of free software
  organizations like the openSUSE Travel Support Program, the GNOME&#39;s Conference
  Travel Subsidy Program or the KDE e.V. Travel Cost Reimbursement initiative.

%p
  Although been developed initially at the openSUSE Team at SUSE, the goal is to
  write a generic application including all the common features so it can be extended
  and adapted to fulfill the needs of any organization. As a result, the workflow
  of requests and reimbursement processes can change. This document shows
  workflow diagrams automatically generated from the current configuration.

%h2 Applying for support

%p
  The whole process happens in the context of an event. In the
  =link_to "events list", events_path
  you can see open events accepting sponsorship requests. Depending of the permissions
  configuration, you will be able to create new events or only to apply to
  previously existing events. You can click in the event name to access to the
  general view of the event, which includes an &#39;apply&#39; button/link. Clicking on it
  creates a new &#39;request&#39;.

%p
  You should fulfill all the information in the request form. The most important
  information is probably the &#39;expenses&#39; section, which describes how are you
  planning to spend the money. You can add as many expenses as needed, specifying
  the amount you are planning to spend on every one using the &#39;estimated
  amount/currency&#39; column. Sometimes you will know the
  exact amount in advance and sometimes you will have to do an estimation.
  Once you get a reply from the Travel Support Program managers, you will see real
  approved amount for every expense in the &#39;approved amount&#39; column. If you
  finally accept the proposal,
  %strong you will only get the approved amount, not the estimated one.
  Keep this in mind.

%p
  You can save the request at any moment and edit it later, since it will be always
  available in
  = link_to "your requests list.", requests_path
  One important note: creating, editing or saving your request DOES NOT send it to the
  Travel Support Program managers. As long as the request state is &#39;incomplete&#39;,
  it will be under your own control until you decide to change the state by using one
  of the options in the &#39;action&#39; dropdown button.

%p
  Understanding the &#39;state&#39; field is the key for using the whole system since the
  interaction between applicants, Travel Support Program members and other
  individuals is performed by means of &#39;actions&#39; which
  change the &#39;state&#39; of the request, always following the workflow diagram below.
  = image_tag "Request_state.png", :alt => "Request workflow diagram"

%p
  Everytime somebody changes the state of a request, he/she can write a message
  explaining the reason of the change. Both the applicant and the Travel Support
  Program members will be notified by mail. As and applicant, your goal should be
  to reach the &#39;accepted&#39; state. The state also determines who can modify the
  request. For example, you will be able to change your request information while
  it&#39;s on &#39;incomplete&#39; state, but only Travel Support Program members can change
  requests in &#39;submited&#39; state.

%h2 Asking for reimbursement

%p
  When the event is over, you can go to your accepted request and click the &#39;ask for
  reimbursement&#39; button. It will create a new reimbursement, which is quite similar
  to a request but includes more fields and have a slightly longer workflow, with some
  additional states. The new reimbursement will be added to
  = link_to "your reimbursements list", reimbursements_path
  at the left menu.

%p
  The main operation is almost identical to the requests, with fields for describing
  your activities, for providing your bank information and the final real amount for
  every expense, for attaching the corresponding invoices or any other relevant files
  and for linking to your reports. Before submiting the reimbursement, make sure that
  the personal information in
  - if user_signed_in?
    = link_to "your profile", profile_path
  - else
    your profile
  is up to date by checking the printable version of the reimbursement or by clicking
  on your username, in the top right corner of the page, next to the &#39;log out&#39;
  link.

- if TravelSupport::Config.setting :opensuse_connect, :enabled
  %p
    Some of the information in the profile cannot be entered directly in the
    application. That information is read from
    = link_to "openSUSE Connect", TravelSupport::Config.setting(:opensuse_connect, :base_url)
    and should be updated in the Connect profile of the user.

%p
  The full workflow for a reimbursement is displayed below. Once more, the only two
  actions that the applicant needs to perform are &#39;submit&#39; (for sending the
  information to the Travel Support Program members) and &#39;accept&#39;. The last
  states are administrative states related to the payment.
  = image_tag "Reimbursement_state.png", :alt => "Reimbursement workflow diagram"

%p
  There is an additional requirement for accepting reimbursements compared to accepting
  requests. In the same way that before clicking on &#39;submit&#39; you need to fulfill
  all the information, before clicking on &#39;accept&#39; you need to upload a signed
  version of the reimbursement. That means printing (click on &#39;printable
  version&#39;), signing with a pen, scanning the result and uploading it (click on
  &#39;attach signature&#39;). If you already did it but your reimbursement was rejected
  and you are performing your second acceptance, make sure to update the signed file to
  fit the current information in the application.
